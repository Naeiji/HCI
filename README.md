This is the code we implemented for the HCI project including two games called Snake and Space Invaders.

You can play both games via either keyboard or gamepad. In order to use gamepad, you should add [Jamepad](https://github.com/williamahartman/Jamepad) jar file to the project. No requirement for keyboard.

P.N. Space Invaders is a game based on [this tutorial](http://www.cokeandcode.com/info/tut2d.html).
